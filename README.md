# beachfront-unified-prototype

This is a proof of concept showing what the repo structure and build process would look like if we merge Beachfront UI and API.

```bash

# develop (visit http://localhost:8080 in browser)
./scripts/install-dependencies.sh
./scripts/run-in-development-mode.sh

# build
./scripts/build.sh
```
